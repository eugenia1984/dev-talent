A website was created for a fictitious HR consulting company called: devTalent.

This "fake" recruiting agency specialized in sourcing IT profiles, gave me the task of developing their site with the intention of modernizing their current online presence.


## Some of their needs as "clients" are:

- Show their services to potential companies that need to hire new Human Resources.

- Detail active job offers on the site.

- Get in touch with new Devs who are looking for a job.

- Contemplate the development of a "blog" section within the project.


## Some technical requirements for the development of the challenge:

- Good SEO practices.

- Mobile first experience

- Good site performance

- Take accessibility into account.

## <img width="48" height="48" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/folder-tree.png" alt="folder tree"/> Project structure 

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for .astro or .md files in the src/pages/ directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about src/components/, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/ directory.
